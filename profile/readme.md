# [![unified][logo]][org]

**unified** is two things:

*   **[unified][site]** is a collective of 500+ free and open source packages
    that work with content as structured data (ASTs)
*   [`unified`][unified] is the core package to inspect and transform content
    with plugins

Different kinds of content can be connected together.
Particularly, markdown, natural language, HTML, XML, and JavaScript are
frequently used.

*   for more about us, see [`unifiedjs.com`][site]
*   for how the collective is governed, see [`unifiedjs/collective`][collective]
*   for updates, see [@unifiedjs][twitter] on Twitter
